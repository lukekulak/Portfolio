# About

## This app was created to explore what Python/Django has to offer, since I plan to begin experimenting with building tools that can be practically helpful to pharmacists. 
See "Feature Pictures" folder to see some of the integrated views the code renders.

### Selected skills I picked up are below:
   * Django core features - models, views, html templates & inheritance, SQLite development DB, migrations, routes, urlpatterns, etc.
   * HTML/CSS/Bootsrap, since I had little knowledge of these before<
   * Django shell/admin functionality
   * HTTP - GET and POST requests
   * Forms/Model Forms
   * Create/Update/Delete using class-based views
        
### Below are some key features of the site:
   * Home page that will show, reverse chronologically, user-created posts
   * User & Profile login/logout and registration system. Includes default and changeable profile pictures
   * Editable posts if the current singed-in profile is the author of the post
   * Crispy forms formatting
   * Automatic profile picture resizing
   * Conditional pagination

Please note: this is very much a beginner project to learn the ropes. No data in the files is important.
