# Rationale

Gain a base knowledge of average year-over-year salary change for various professions. I hope to expand upon this base to evaluate how the Covid-19 pandemic and it's inflationary effects may have altered the trends, and if differences exist across professions. 

# Data collection

All data gathered from yearly tables listed on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm)
- Ideally, a larger time frame would have been used for analysis, however, the groupings of physician specialties are inconsistent across the data sets for different years.
- 2012-2018 were used as they had consistent physician groupings.

Excel was used to filter relevant records for each year and form a single CSV file to house relevant data.
